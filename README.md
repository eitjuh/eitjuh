### Hi there 👋

I'm Jesse, working as an Engineering Manager for the last couple of years.

Please also check my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesseeilers/)

❤️ I love engineering, and I love working with people even more. My greatest desire is to get out the untapped potential in as much as possible people. People can achieve endlessly more if they work well together and if they feel safe, feel cared for, and feel belonging. This is what I bring to organizations. I constantly get the best out of people and ensure we find win-win situations: I ensure every individual can improve, while improving organizations. I love autonomous teams and strongly believe in servant leadership. I would call myself an obsessive self-improver and I am proud to be a dreamer.

Please reach out to me for anything. I love meeting new people, love a huge variety of topics, love learning, love side projects, love opportunities to work together and so forth. Please don't hesitate reaching out to me.❤️
